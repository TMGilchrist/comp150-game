    """
    CharacterCreation class. This class displays a character creation window and allows the user to edit the apperance
    of their character.

    Attributes:
        path_to_assets (string): The file path to the assets folder. This should later be added to the constructor so it can be passed in when the class is instantiated.
        blank_component (image): A blank image that is used as a placeholder
        blank_base (image): The image used for the base of the sprite

        main_screen (pygame.Display): The character creation window
        background_colour (pygame.Colour): The colour for the main window.
        buttons (list of Buttons): A list of the Buttons on the screen.

        char_position (tuple): The position of the player_char on the screen.
        player_char (Sprite): The player character's Sprite. player_char.image used to access the image

        body_choices (list of Surfaces): The images that the player can choose from for the body component.
        hair_choices (list of Surfaces): The images that the player can choose from for the hair component.
        legs_choices (list of Surfaces): The images that the player can choose from for the legs component.

        body_index (int): The position in the body_choices array. Used to save the user's place.
        hair_index (int): The position in the hair_choices array. Used to save the user's place.
        legs_index (int): The position in the legs_choices array. Used to save the user's place.

        # These are set in __init__ so that length only has to be calculated once.
        body_choices_length (int): The length of the body_choices list.
        hair_choices_length (int): The length of the hair_choices list.
        legs_choices_length (int): The length of the legs_choices list.

        loading (bool): Sets if the program loads the player_char from a serialized file. Mainly for testing.
        running (bool): State of the pygame window. Window remains open while running is True.
