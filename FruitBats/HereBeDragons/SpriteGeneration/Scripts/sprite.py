            base (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite base.
            legs (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite's legs.
            body (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite's body.
            hair (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite's head.
            feet (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite's feet.
            weapon (pygame.Surface): The image to use for the sprite's weapon. Note that in the current implementation this
                                     is always passed a placeholder of 0, as weapon sprites have not been added to the assets folder.
                                     Similarily, the weapon image is not blitted to the sprite image in the draw functions, as there is no image.
